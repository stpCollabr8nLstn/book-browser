Tony and Sean primarily worked on creating the basic pages and routing.  
Adriana and Ashleigh worked on the styling of the pages.  There were some hiccups regarding the Author page that Sean worked on, namely forgetting to include some information not related to the bio.  There was also some trouble related to inheritence and styling, however that was fixed over these last couple of days.  The primary resource used was Flask documentation and referencing Assignment 1's core concepts.  Also, there was some confusion regarding github, hence us just using a prjoect that Sean invited people to, including Dr. Ekstrand.
